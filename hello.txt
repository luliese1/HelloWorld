If anyone still has problems with jumping after pressing the pause button, just add the following inside the curly brackets of the getKeyDown & getMouseDown piece in the PlayerController:
//This will check if an UI element has been clicked. If so, dont jump!
if (EventSystem.current.IsPointerOverGameObject())
{
          return;
}
